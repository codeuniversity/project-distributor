## Project Data ##
For privacy reasons the actual project applications are not stored in the repository. 

Create a file called `project-applications` in the `src/main/resources` folder with 
the actual data to run the optimizer. 

## IDE Setup ##
I would recommend IntelliJ Idea. 
Use `File > New > Project from Version Control > Git` to clone this repo.

## Testing ##
Run `./gradlew test` from the commandline or use IntelliJ to run the unit tests.
